# 🌦️ Weather Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Weather Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**. The dashboard provides clear and visually engaging insights into weather patterns, helping users understand trends across temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other key weather metrics.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong **data visualization**, **data modeling**, and **analytical storytelling** skills using Power BI—without relying on advanced DAX, keeping the analysis clean and beginner‑friendly.

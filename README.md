# 🌦️ Weather Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Weather Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**. The dashboard provides clear and visually engaging insights into weather patterns, helping users understand trends across temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other key weather metrics.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong **data visualization**, **data modeling**, and **analytical storytelling** skills using Power BI—without relying on advanced DAX, keeping the analysis clean and beginner‑friendly.

## Key Features

* **7‑Day Temperature Forecast (Min / Max)** – Track upcoming temperature trends
* **Sunrise & Sunset Timings** – Daily solar timings for better planning
* **Rain Probability (%)** – Chance of rainfall displayed clearly
* **Wind Speed & Direction** – Understand wind behavior at a glance
* **Humidity & Atmospheric Pressure** – Monitor comfort and pressure levels
* **Visibility Index** – Indicates visibility conditions
* **UV Index** – Helps assess sun exposure risk
* **Air Quality Index (AQI)** *(optional extension)* – Indicates pollution levels
* **Real‑Time Weather Data** – Integrated using WeatherAPI for up‑to‑date insights
